# Contributing to LearningOrchestra
We want to make contributing to LearningOrchestra as easy and as simple as humanly possible.\
Whether you want to:
* Report an issue
* Contribute with a feature
* Contribute with a fix

Before you open an issue or a pull request, check whether that issue has been discussed already or a PR exists that addresses it. Don't open pull requests for issues that are already under review.

After looking through the issues and seeing that an issue is available for you to tackle, you may begin the pull request process.

### Reporting a bug/issue
When creating an issue for a bug or other undefined/unwanted behaviour remember to include in your issue or pull request steps necessary to reproduce that behaviour.

## Pull Request process

1. [Fork](https://github.com/riibeirogabriel/learningOrchestra/fork) the repository
2. [Clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) your fork to your local environment
3. Navigate into the project root directory
4. Create a new [branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging), the branch should be named according to what feature/fix you're implementing
5. Make your changes, stage them and [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) them to the branch
    - Make sure to use proper language idioms, formatting and linting before committing your work, like proper variable naming, indentation, etc.
    - Make sure your code passes any tests the repository offers
    - Make sure to adopt the coding style of the repository and not to force your own coding habits into the codebase
6. [Push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) the changes to your fork
7. Create a Pull Request

Remember to describe what feature or fix you're implementing in the Pull Request window.
In the Pull Request window remember to include a quick summary of what the committed code does and how it is an improvement. 

After the Pull Request has been submitted, the repository owner will review your request.\
Be patient, if they require you to make changes to your request, do so.
